So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most &lsquo;scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; Just &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; and no more.</p><p>Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, &lsquo;Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.</p><p>Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said, &lsquo;Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.</p><p>Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said, &lsquo;Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.</p><p>At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox together, and said, &lsquo;Three, O Three, I&rsquo;m very sorry for you (with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can&rsquo;t work, or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make up for it.&rsquo;</p><p>That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they held a palaver, and an <em>indaba</em>, and a <em>punchayet</em>, and a pow-wow on the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed <em>most</em> &lsquo;scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; and went away again.</p><p>Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.</p><p>&lsquo;Djinn of All Deserts,&rsquo; said the Horse, &lsquo;is it right for any one to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said the Djinn.</p><p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Horse, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a thing in the middle of your Howling Desert (and he&rsquo;s a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and he hasn&rsquo;t done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won&rsquo;t trot.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; said the Djinn, whistling, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s my Camel, for all the gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;He says &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;&rsquo; said the Dog; &lsquo;and he won&rsquo;t fetch and carry.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Does he say anything else?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Only &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;; and he won&rsquo;t plough,&rsquo; said the Ox.</p><p>&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said the Djinn. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll humph him if you will kindly wait a minute.&rsquo;</p><p>The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across the desert, and found the Camel most &lsquo;scruciatingly idle, looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.</p><p>&lsquo;My long and bubbling friend,&rsquo; said the Djinn, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s this I hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the Camel.</p><p>The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of water.</p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on account of your &lsquo;scruciating idleness,&rsquo; said the Djinn; and he went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.</p><p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the Camel.</p><p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say that again if I were you,&rsquo; said the Djinn; you might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.&rsquo;</p><p>And the Camel said &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; again; but no sooner had he said it than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.</p><p>&lsquo;Do you see that?&rsquo; said the Djinn. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s your very own humph that you&rsquo;ve brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is Thursday, and you&rsquo;ve done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now you are going to work.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;How can I,&rsquo; said the Camel, &lsquo;with this humph on my back?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s made a-purpose,&rsquo; said the Djinn, &lsquo;all because you missed those three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don&rsquo;t you ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!&rsquo;</p><p>And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it &lsquo;hump&rsquo; now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to behave.</p><pre><code> THE Camel's hump is an ugly lump
   Which well you may see at the Zoo;
 But uglier yet is the hump we get
   From having too little to do.

 Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
 If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
     We get the hump--
     Cameelious hump--
 The hump that is black and blue!

 We climb out of bed with a frouzly head
   And a snarly-yarly voice.
 We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
   At our bath and our boots and our toys;

 And there ought to be a corner for me
 (And I know there is one for you)
     When we get the hump--
     Cameelious hump--
 The hump that is black and blue!

 The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
   Or frowst with a book by the fire;
 But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
   And dig till you gently perspire;

 And then you will find that the sun and the wind.
 And the Djinn of the Garden too,
     Have lifted the hump--
     The horrible hump--
 The hump that is black and blue!

 I get it as well as you-oo-oo--
 If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo--
     We all get hump--
     Cameelious hump--
 Kiddies and grown-ups too!
